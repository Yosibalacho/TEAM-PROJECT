          One Piece is a manga and anime series created by Japanese manga artist
          Aichiro Oda. The story begins 22 years before the plot of the series
          took place, the legendary pirate "Gol D. Roger" was executed, who is
          considered the greatest pirate of all time and won the title of "King
          of Pirates".

        <div class="text-black text-center mt-3">
          Prior to his execution, Roger stated that he had left behind all of
          his great treasures he had collected over the years, That Called the
          "One Piece," and its hidden in the open sea in a secret place. In his
          last words Roger calls on the citizens to go out to sea and search for
          the treasure. In doing so, he opened the "Age of the Great Pirates"
          during which thousands of different pirates set out in search of the
          "One Piece" treasure.

        <div class="text-black text-center mt-3">
          The plot of the series, as it were, begins after the execution of
          Roger. The protagonist of the series, a young boy named "Monkey D.
          Luffy" leaves the village where he grew up in order to find the
          treasure of the "One Piece" and become the king of pirates. During the
          journey, Luffy is joined by other team members with different
          aspirations And later they form the "Straw Hats" team, named after the
          straw hat that Luffy wears.

        <div class="text-black text-center mt-3">
          Unlike the rest of the pirates in the series, the "Straw Hats" team
          are moral people who avoid unnecessary killing and help people in
          trouble. However, since the Straw Hat team is considered a pirate, in
          the eyes of the "Marines" (the Navy navy that is the military force in
          the One piece world) they are defined as dangerous and criminal, and
          therefore persecuted by both the Marines and the "World Government".
